        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="main">
          <p class="innertext">
            My name is Jad El-Khatib, and I'm currently a Web Applications Developer at the College of Engineering's
            CAEN department at the University of Michigan. Born and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan to Syrian parents, my
            family had a feeling early on that I would have a future in computing. Shortly after grade school, I studied
            Computer Science at Eastern Michigan University while working at our family-owned bakery. Those years taught
            me perseverance and creativity, and I poured that into my first substantial personal project, AGOSS (A Game
            of Some Sort). Building features like custom save and mapping systems gave me the confidence to branch out
            from the family business and start my professional career in tech.
          </p>
          <p class="innertext">
            I began my career at the University of Michigan's central IT department (ITS), where I worked on large-scale
            projects intended for use across the Ann Arbor campus and potentially other U-M campuses. While some
            initiatives were shelved during the COVID-19 shift in priorities, the experience prepared me for my move to
            the College of Engineering. At CAEN, I've spent the past 4½ years developing and maintaining internal
            applications for stakeholders across the college, including position management systems, performance review
            platforms, and scholarship award systems. While I often operate as a solo developer within a team
            environment, I work closely with stakeholders as a project owner and maintainer to ensure applications meet
            their needs.
          </p>
          <p class="innertext">
            Outside of my university work, I am the technical co-founder of CloudCompany, where we developed
            <em>Skillrocket</em>, a mobile app designed to teach IT skills in engaging, accessible ways—whether through
            the web or natively on mobile. While the app is no longer in active development, the experience was
            invaluable, and my co-founder and I still keep in touch to explore other creative ideas we might bring to
            life in the future.
          </p>
          <p class="innertext">
            Whether in my university role or personal ventures, I aim to create tools and experiences that solve
            problems, empower others, and inspire learning. I’m driven by the belief that good software isn’t just
            functional—it should be intuitive, impactful, and built with the people using it in mind.
